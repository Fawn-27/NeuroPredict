# NeuroPredict: Your Personal Headache Assistant ðŸ§ 

## ðŸ’¡ About the Project:
* Headaches are a common, and often debilitating, medical issue. With so many types, from migraines to sinus headaches, the overlapping symptoms can make self-diagnosis a real challenge.
* NeuroPredict is a data-driven classification model and large language model (LLM) designed to solve this problem. It accurately predicts the type of headache a user is experiencing based on reported symptoms. Beyond diagnosis, it provides actionable advice, including home remedies or recommendations to seek professional medical help.
